# StudentDataAnalysis
Hey Folks,

This project is 3 year long project of which I was part. I have done initial analysis of student data of Fairleigh Dickinson University.I can not provide data because of confidentiality. However, you can get some idea by looking into Jupyter Notebooks. Everything is done by myself while learning simultaneously. Any suggestions, edits are welcome and appreciated. I am still new in Data field. 

ABOUT PROJECT:

It is proposed by Dr.Ravi Rao, Assistant professor of Gildart Hasse School of Computer Science and Engineering at Fairleigh Dickinson Univesity New Jersey USA. The proposal is to analyze students performance based on data available from past and create two types of prediction models. The first model will generate short term prediction of student’s performance in current courses. This can be helpful for university and faculty to take immediate actions based on performance. The second model is to generate future prediction of student’s success in any course. It can make a huge impact on student's career and university's quality of education. 

Technologies/Frameworks/Libraries will be used:

This project is going to developed using python. It may need to use several open source libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Plotly, Seaborn, D3.js, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Tensorflow etc.

NOTE:

This is not a full project. Like I already mentioned that it is 3 year long project and I was part in the beginning. So, whatever is done by me is available. However, If development occure in future by me then I will surely update it.
